## Hi, I'm Ona! 🇿🇦
### 👩‍💻 About me: 
I am a South African Computer Science student at the University of Stellenbosch with a passion for life-long learning and skill development. 
I aspire to create websites and applications which will positively impact the lives of others. 
🔭 I’m currently working on building my programming skills in Python, JavaScript and other programming languages! 
###    Tech Stack: 
Python / Java / JS / GIT / GITHUB

### ⚡ Fun fact: 
I am a Linguistics nerd and bookworm too! I love learning about new languages, and also about how they were created and how they've evolved over time! I am a huge Potterhead, and my favourite authors are John Green and Malorie Blackman. 📖
